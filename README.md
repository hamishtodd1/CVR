## What is this?

This is, or will be, ["Coot"](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/personal/pemsley/coot/) in VR. Much more will be done but so far you can *view* (but not change) the state of the molecule in VR

## Why is this being made?

We hope it will make Coot faster to use! It will be easier to see 3D features, to specify intended atom detinations, and to navigate some of the information you need to use Coot (because you have more "screen space"). It will also be easier to train people to use.

## How do I set it up

Right now there's not guarantee of stability, you'll need a bit of skillz. You'll need Windows, an Oculus Rift and webVR (I recommend this build https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzudLt22BqGRRElMNmVqQjJWS2c - make sure to go to chrome://flags and enable webVR AND gamepad extensions). Run the server.py script inside coot then open index.html in your browser.

## Any plans for this to be compatible with other headsets?


Yes! Actually it should work on the Vive already, just give me a poke on twitter (hamishtodd1) if it doesn't. I don't own any other position-tracked headsets, but if you work at Sony/Samsung/Lenovo/Acer/Dell/HP/wherever else, send me a headset and I should be able to get it working

But no to all "Cardboard" headsets including Daydream and GearVR. In the history of this repo you will find a version compatible with daydream, but it was a nightmare to get the pointer working and it is not clear what payoff there is, apart from having a super-cheap thing available to people. Read my PhD thesis (ETA 09/2019) if you want to hear UI reasons too I guess!

## Will you have feature <x> from Coot?

I want as much of Coot's functionality in here as possible! The only things I do not currently expect to happen in here are things that require typing strings of symbols on the keyboard, eg "save as" or "fetch specific ligand from the internet".

## Are you going to have voice control?

NO STOP ASKING FOR THIS I AM A PURVEYOR OF FUTURISTIC SOFTWARE BUT I AM NOT A GENIE
