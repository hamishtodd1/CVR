I will listen then...
12:26 PMPaul EmsleyChi angles
12:26 PMPaul EmsleyEdit Chi angles.
12:26 PMPaul EmsleyNot quite.
12:27 PMPaul EmsleyThere is a slider that affects both the model and the Ramachandran plot
12:27 PMPaul EmsleyYou can't pull the points on the ramachandran plot
12:27 PMPaul EmsleyThat is a specific and very useful case of residue-range refine
12:28 PMPaul Emsleyone up, central residue, one down
12:28 PMPaul EmsleyCoot does the residue selection based on the central residue
12:28 PMPaul Emsleyyou don't have to click on them
12:28 PMPaul EmsleyPress the T key
12:29 PMPaul Emsley(not shift T)
12:29 PMPaul EmsleyHmmm...
12:30 PMPaul EmsleyI rarely use the non-autofit version
12:30 PMPaul EmsleyMaybe the model is in the wrong place.
12:30 PMPaul Emsleyyes.
12:30 PMPaul EmsleyYes.
12:31 PMPaul Emsley:-)
12:32 PMPaul EmsleyHmm..
12:32 PMPaul EmsleyI don't understand the quesiton
12:32 PMPaul EmsleyWhen do you think it should be doing refinement?
12:32 PMPaul Emsley"all the time"?
12:32 PMPaul EmsleyOh I see.
12:32 PMPaul EmsleyHmm
12:33 PMPaul EmsleyYes.
12:33 PMPaul EmsleyWell... many tools do end in refinement
12:33 PMPaul EmsleyOr we could script them so that they do.
12:33 PMPaul EmsleyYes... 
12:33 PMPaul EmsleyThe engine is the same, the atom selections are different
12:34 PMPaul EmsleyYes, it gets converted into an array of atoms
12:34 PMPaul EmsleyI hope so
12:34 PMPaul EmsleySo how far did you get with the mutate tool?
12:34 PMPaul EmsleyCan you select them
12:35 PMPaul Emsley?
12:35 PMPaul EmsleyOK.
12:35 PMPaul EmsleyYes
12:36 PMPaul EmsleyIndex 0
12:36 PMPaul Emsley....
12:36 PMPaul EmsleyIf you are dealing with protein models, no
12:36 PMPaul Emsleyit will not be like that.
12:36 PMPaul EmsleyThat's right.
12:36 PMPaul EmsleyIt's a drug
12:36 PMPaul EmsleyOK!
12:37 PMPaul EmsleySounds good.
12:37 PMPaul EmsleyIt is the connection to coot that seems the tricky bit
12:37 PMPaul Emsley(to me)
12:37 PMPaul EmsleyYou will send "mutate_and_autofit"
12:38 PMPaul Emsleyas the tool choice 
12:38 PMPaul Emsleyand send the atom spec string of the "picked" atom
12:38 PMPaul Emsleycoot server is listening and will act on those strings.
12:38 PMPaul EmsleyIn fact, the atom spec is best not a string
12:39 PMPaul Emsleybut split into fields, 
12:39 PMPaul Emsleymodel-number chain-id residue-number (etc)
12:39 PMPaul Emsleyas a list of attributes
12:40 PMPaul Emsleythat's right
12:40 PMPaul EmsleyI will read the docs...
12:41 PMPaul Emsleyone moment
12:41 PMPaul EmsleyYes.
12:42 PMPaul EmsleyI should do a python version of the documentation
12:42 PMPaul EmsleyNext function
12:42 PMPaul Emsleyno.
12:42 PMPaul EmsleyI meant next function down in the documentation
12:42 PMPaul Emsleyoh
12:43 PMPaul Emsleyha!
12:43 PMPaul Emsleyinconsistency
12:43 PMPaul Emsley:-(
12:43 PMPaul EmsleyI don't know
12:43 PMPaul Emsleythat's a good start :-)
12:43 PMPaul Emsley"ALA"
12:44 PMPaul Emsley"TYR"
12:44 PMPaul Emsley(etc)
12:44 PMPaul Emsleyk
12:44 PMPaul Emsleyok
12:44 PMPaul EmsleyYes.
12:44 PMPaul EmsleyNot first priority
12:44 PMPaul Emsleythat is more important
12:44 PMPaul Emsleypepflip flips the atoms of the mainchain
12:45 PMPaul Emsleysidechain 180 flips the last chi angle of a side chain
12:45 PMPaul EmsleyPerhaps I shouldn't be typing here.
12:45 PMPaul Emsleythere is no record though.
12:45 PMPaul Emsleyother window will record.
12:45 PMPaul EmsleyOK
12:45 PMPaul Emsleys
12:46 PMPaul Emsleyyes
12:46 PMPaul EmsleyYes.
12:46 PMPaul EmsleyYes.
12:46 PMPaul Emsleythat's right.
12:46 PMPaul EmsleyThat will involve coot sending intermediate atoms.
12:46 PMPaul EmsleyThe functions that don't send intermediate atoms will be easier.
12:47 PMPaul Emsleye.g. mutate-and-auto-fit
12:47 PMPaul EmsleyYes
12:47 PMPaul Emsleyand so is refine.
12:47 PMPaul Emsleyoften.
12:47 PMPaul EmsleyThere can be auto-accept version too.
12:47 PMPaul EmsleyBoth have the same user interface.
12:48 PMPaul Emsleyrefine fits to the map.
12:48 PMPaul Emsleysingle residue or arbitrary atom selections, yes
12:49 PMPaul Emsleynot single atoms
12:49 PMPaul EmsleyRefine-and-autofit is easy/usefule
12:50 PMPaul Emsleybah
12:50 PMPaul EmsleyNo
12:50 PMPaul EmsleyNot that.
12:50 PMPaul Emsleymutate-and-auto-fit is easy/useful
12:50 PMPaul Emsleyrefine is top usefulness
12:50 PMPaul EmsleyThat's what I would suggest
12:51 PMPaul EmsleySo have you seen it in the daydream?
12:51 PMPaul Emsleybecause?
12:51 PMPaul EmsleyOh.
12:51 PMPaul EmsleyI don't hahaha
12:51 PMPaul Emsley"It's behind you..."
12:51 PMPaul EmsleyYes.
12:52 PMPaul EmsleyVery useful.
12:52 PMPaul EmsleyHm
12:52 PMPaul EmsleyIt won't flip a ligand or a residue at the end of a chain
12:52 PMPaul EmsleyHmm....
12:53 PMPaul Emsleyok, good.
12:54 PMPaul Emsley""
12:54 PMPaul Emsleyhigh resolution structures often have residues
12:54 PMPaul Emsleyin several (often 2) conformers...
12:54 PMPaul EmsleyA set of positions "A" and a set of positions "B"
12:55 PMPaul EmsleyYes.
12:55 PMPaul EmsleyYes.
12:55 PMPaul EmsleyHmm...
12:55 PMPaul EmsleySo...
12:55 PMPaul Emsleyshall we arrange next week?
12:56 PMPaul EmsleyFriday
12:56 PMPaul EmsleySo shall we go to Cambridge on Monday?
12:56 PMPaul EmsleyOr we could meet at the weekend?
12:56 PMPaul EmsleyThat's fine too.
12:56 PMPaul Emsleyok
12:57 PMPaul EmsleyI am keen on 2 things.
12:57 PMPaul Emsley1: communications of your edit wishes to coot
12:57 PMPaul Emsley2: rotating the molecule
12:58 PMPaul Emsleyorienting, "pulling it here"
12:58 PMPaul EmsleyI want to look at this "from the top"
12:58 PMPaul EmsleyHahaha
12:58 PMPaul EmsleyI laugh at your ... 
12:59 PMPaul Emsleydoubt
12:59 PMPaul EmsleyHaha.
12:59 PMPaul Emsleyyes!
12:59 PMPaul EmsleyI'd like to see it on the daydream, fwiw.
12:59 PMPaul Emsley... hang on!
1:00 PMPaul Emsleysay that again...
1:00 PMPaul EmsleyYes....
1:01 PMPaul EmsleyOK so far.
1:01 PMPaul Emsleycan you send a screeny of that?
1:01 PMPaul EmsleyAh!
1:01 PMPaul EmsleyI see.
1:01 PMPaul Emsleyprobably everything that's closer than 1.6A
1:02 PMPaul Emsleyis bonded.
1:02 PMPaul Emsley1.6 is about the right number
1:02 PMPaul EmsleyYes...
1:02 PMPaul Emsleythe bonding in the general case is non-trivial
1:02 PMPaul EmsleyI'd like that not to be the case.
1:02 PMPaul EmsleyI'd like stretchy bonds rather than broken bonds.
1:03 PMPaul EmsleyCoot is not sending you a PDB file.
1:03 PMPaul EmsleyOK
1:03 PMPaul Emsley:-) 
1:04 PMPaul EmsleyOK, so... communication with coot server
1:05 PMPaul EmsleyI think that is an issue.
1:05 PMPaul EmsleyDo you?
1:05 PMPaul EmsleyGood choice
1:06 PMPaul Emsleyyou only need one.
1:06 PMPaul Emsley:-)
1:06 PMPaul Emsley... "just call that function"
1:07 PMPaul EmsleyHahahaha.
1:07 PMPaul EmsleyOK.
1:07 PMPaul EmsleyHmm.
1:07 PMPaul EmsleyOK...
1:08 PMPaul EmsleyI see.
1:08 PMPaul EmsleySo you just send Coot a string?
1:08 PMPaul EmsleyOK!
1:08 PMPaul EmsleyOK....
1:08 PMPaul EmsleyYour python script is running in the coot server
1:08 PMPaul EmsleyYes, I think I follow
1:08 PMPaul Emsleysay that again please
1:09 PMPaul Emsleyfollowing...
1:09 PMPaul Emsleyok...
1:10 PMPaul Emsleyand that gets interpretted.
1:10 PMPaul EmsleyOK...
1:10 PMPaul EmsleyOK.
1:10 PMPaul Emsleyso similar ... for mutate-and-auto-fit and an atom spec
1:11 PMPaul Emsleyyes :-)
1:11 PMPaul Emsleyhahaha.
1:11 PMPaul EmsleyYes.
1:11 PMPaul EmsleyI think I prefer the current method.
1:12 PMPaul EmsleyDo the string parsing in the server
1:12 PMPaul Emsleyyes...
1:12 PMPaul Emsleyevery fraction of a second.
1:12 PMPaul Emsleythat would be nice.
1:12 PMPaul EmsleyThe updated coordinates..
1:13 PMPaul EmsleyYes!
1:13 PMPaul Emsleyexactly.
1:13 PMPaul Emsleythe updated coordinates will be bigger
1:13 PMPaul Emsleyatoms...
1:13 PMPaul Emsleyyes.
1:13 PMPaul EmsleyI imagine so.
1:13 PMPaul Emsleyok!
1:14 PMPaul EmsleyYes.
1:15 PMPaul EmsleyIf we can go that fast... that will be fine
1:15 PMPaul Emsley(hahaha!)
1:15 PMPaul EmsleyYes...
1:15 PMPaul Emsleythis part is intriguing for me.
1:15 PMPaul EmsleySunday?
1:15 PMPaul EmsleyAfternoon or evening.
1:16 PMPaul EmsleyI will need to chec,
1:16 PMPaul Emsleybut we could say 5pm now...
1:16 PMPaul Emsleyand adjust as needed later.
1:16 PMPaul Emsleynice and sunny here.
